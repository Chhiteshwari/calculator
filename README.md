## Calculator App

This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

### Features

- **Basic Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear and Delete:** "AC" button clears the display and "DEL" button removes the last entered digit.
- **Percentage:** Calculate percentages using the "%" button.
- **Parentheses:** Use parentheses for grouping operations.
- **Error Handling:** Handles invalid expressions and displays an "Error" message.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Keyboard Support:** Use the "Enter" key to evaluate the expression.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML:**  
    - Defines the structure of the calculator using divs, buttons, and input fields.
    - Implements basic HTML elements like `main`, `div`, `button`, `input`, etc. 
- **CSS:**
    - Styles the calculator to make it visually appealing.
    - Uses Flexbox for layout and responsiveness.
    - Adds background image and color schemes for a visually appealing design.
    - Uses media queries for responsive adjustments for smaller screen sizes.
- **JavaScript:**
    - Handles user interaction and logic.
    - Dynamically updates the display based on user input.
    - Implements the calculator logic for performing operations and displaying results.
    - Uses `addEventListener` to handle button clicks and keyboard input.
    - Uses `eval()` to evaluate the expression entered by the user. 

### Functionality

1. **Input:** Users enter numbers and operators by clicking the buttons or using the keyboard. 
2. **Display:** The input is displayed in the input field.
3. **Calculation:** When the "=" button is clicked or the "Enter" key is pressed, the expression is evaluated, and the result is displayed.
4. **Clear & Delete:** The "AC" button clears the entire input, and the "DEL" button removes the last entered digit. 

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser.**

### Future Improvements

- **More Advanced Operations:** Implement functions like square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric operations.
- **History:** Store the history of calculations for easy reference.
- **Themes:** Allow users to choose from different themes or color schemes.
- **Unit Converter:** Add a feature to convert between different units.
